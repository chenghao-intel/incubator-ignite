/**
 * <b>IG</b>nite <b>F</b>ile <b>S</b>ystem API. It provides a typical file system "view" on a particular cache:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>list directories or get information for a single path</li>
 *     <li>create/move/delete files or directories</li>
 *     <li>write/read data streams into/from files</li>
 * </ul>
 * The data of each file is split on separate data blocks and stored in the cache.
 * You can access file's data with a standard Java streaming API. Moreover, for each part
 * of the file you can calculate an affinity and process file's content on corresponding
 * nodes to escape unnecessary networking.
 * <p/>
 * This API is fully thread-safe and you can use it from several threads.
 * <h1 class="header">IGFS Configuration</h1>
 * The simplest way to run a Ignite node with configured file system is to pass
 * special configuration file included in Ignite distribution to {@code ignite.sh} or
 * {@code ignite.bat} scripts, like this: {@code ignite.sh config/hadoop/default-config.xml}
 * <p>
 * {@code IGFS} can be started as a data node or as a client node. Data node is responsible for
 * caching data, while client node is responsible for basic file system operations and accessing
 * data nodes remotely. When used as Hadoop file system, clients nodes usually started together
 * with {@code job-submitter} or {@code job-scheduler} processes, while data nodes are usually
 * started together with Hadoop {@code task-tracker} processes.
 * <h1 class="header">Integration With Hadoop</h1>
 * In addition to direct file system API, {@code IGFS} can be integrated with {@code Hadoop} by
 * plugging in as {@code Hadoop FileSystem}. Refer to
 * {@code org.apache.ignite.igfs.hadoop.v1.IgfsHadoopFileSystem} or
 * {@code org.apache.ignite.igfs.hadoop.v2.IgfsHadoopFileSystem} for more information.
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> integration with Hadoop is available only in {@code In-Memory Accelerator For Hadoop} edition.
