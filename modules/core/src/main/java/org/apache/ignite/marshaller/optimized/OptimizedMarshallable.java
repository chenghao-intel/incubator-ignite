/**
 * Optional interface which helps make serialization even faster by removing internal
 * look-ups for classes.
 * <p>
 * All implementation must have the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *     Must have static filed (private or public) declared of type {@link Object}
 *     with name {@code IGNITE_CLASS_ID}. Ignite will reflectively initialize this field with
 *     proper class ID during system startup.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *     Must return the value of {@code IGNITE_CLASS_ID} field from {@link #ggClassId} method.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * Here is a sample implementation:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * // For better performance consider implementing java.io.Externalizable interface.
 * class ExampleMarshallable implements GridOptimizedMarshallable, Serializable {
 *     // Class ID field required by 'GridOptimizedMarshallable'.
 *     private static Object IGNITE_CLASS_ID;
 *
 *     ...
 *
 *     &#64; public Object ggClassId() {
 *         return IGNITE_CLASS_ID;
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Note that for better performance you should also specify list of classes you
 * plan to serialize via {@link OptimizedMarshaller#setClassNames(List)} method.
