/**
 * Main entry-point for all Ignite APIs.
 * You can obtain an instance of {@code Grid} through {@link Ignition#ignite()},
 * or for named grids you can use {@link Ignition#ignite(String)}. Note that you
 * can have multiple instances of {@code Grid} running in the same VM by giving
 * each instance a different name.
 * <p>
 * Note that {@code Grid} extends {@link ClusterGroup} which means that it provides grid projection
 * functionality over the whole grid (instead of a subgroup of nodes).
 * <p>
 * In addition to {@link ClusterGroup} functionality, from here you can get the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link org.apache.ignite.cache.GridCache} - functionality for in-memory distributed cache.</li>
 * <li>{@link IgniteDataLoader} - functionality for loading data large amounts of data into cache.</li>
 * <li>{@link IgniteFs} - functionality for distributed Hadoop-compliant in-memory file system and map-reduce.</li>
 * <li>{@link IgniteStreamer} - functionality for streaming events workflow with queries and indexes into rolling windows.</li>
 * <li>{@link IgniteScheduler} - functionality for scheduling jobs using UNIX Cron syntax.</li>
 * <li>{@link IgniteCompute} - functionality for executing tasks and closures on all grid nodes (inherited form {@link ClusterGroup}).</li>
 * <li>{@link IgniteMessaging} - functionality for topic-based message exchange on all grid nodes (inherited form {@link ClusterGroup}).</li>
 * <li>{@link IgniteEvents} - functionality for querying and listening to events on all grid nodes  (inherited form {@link ClusterGroup}).</li>
 * </ul>
